# Documentation Freshness Report

This page identifies documentation that may be outdated compared to the source code.
Pages are flagged when source files have been modified after the documentation was generated.

## ✅ All Documentation Up to Date

All 45 file documentation pages are current with their source code.

## Recommendations

To refresh stale documentation:

1. **Re-index the repository** with `force=True` to regenerate all pages
2. **Incremental update** will automatically regenerate pages when source files change
3. **Manual review** may be needed for pages where only comments or docstrings changed
